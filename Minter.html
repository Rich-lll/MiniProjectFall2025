<p>Terraria is a single or multiplayer game where you have to progress and level
up your gear to get stronger and beat the game. Sometimes this game can get boring
    at times, but in my opinion, the more people you play the better you get. There are
    4 different classes you can choose from. This includes mage, ranged, melee, or summoner.
    Each having their own unique playstyle, weapons, armor, tools, etc. Try each of
    them out at some point, get to know your favorite class. Also, you can download
    mods on PC version and play several other classes, game modes, and many more things.

    <p>Minecraft is similar and different compared to Terraria. They have the same
    objective which is beating the game by upgrading gear, multiplayer, gear, etc.
        The main difference is there aren't any classes in Minecraft. Everyone has
        to use the same gear. Another difference is that Minecraft is 3D while Terraria
        is 2D. Both games have there own perks in a way but still pretty similiar. Lastly
        just like Terraria, Minecraft can download mods to access many new things
        too. But if you decide to play either one of these games, play with friends.
